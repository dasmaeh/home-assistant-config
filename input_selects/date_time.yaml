# An input_select to choose the time of day.
# This gets done by automations, so we can use the english lowercase names here
# and use this directly in automations
# (background: I'm using German names in frontend and english in automations
# for internatinal readability wherever possibel. Eg: ids are in English,
# friendly_names in German)
