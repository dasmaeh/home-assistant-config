# My home assistant configuration

Here is my [home assistant}(https://home-assitant.io) configuration. I keep my configuration here as a backup as well as a source of inspiration for others. I regularly update this configuration, star it to keep up with the changes.

To check my current version of home assistant have a look [here](https://github.com/dasmaeh/ha-config/blob/master/.HA_VERSION).

## My system
I'm running [hassOS](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/) as a virtual machine using libvirt/qemu. So basically it's running hass.io in a VM instead of a Raspberry Pi, more or less because a virtual server host is running anyways at my home.

## My devices
I'll try to keep an more or less up to date list of my home automation / IoT devices here.
